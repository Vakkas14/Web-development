Web-Development: It’s everything involved in creating a website—from writing the code that makes it work to designing how it looks and behaves.
 Types of Web Development

1.Frontend Development (Client-Side)
What the user sees and interacts with.
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Frameworks: React, Vue, Angular

2. Backend Development (Server-Side)
Behind-the-scenes logic, databases, authentication, and APIs.
Languages: Node.js, Python, PHP, Java
Databases: MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL

3. Full Stack Development
Combines both frontend and backend.
A full stack developer can build a complete web application end-to-end.

How It Works
Frontend sends a request (e.g., login) from the browser.
Backend processes it (e.g., checks credentials).
Database is queried if needed.
Response is sent back and displayed on the frontend.
